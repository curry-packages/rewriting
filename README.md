rewriting
=========

These libraries provide a representation of first-order terms
and various notions of term rewriting, like position, substitution,
unification, critical pairs, etc. Moreover, it defines also
operations for rewriting and narrowing strategies and a
representation of definitional trees.

A previous version of these libraries were part of the
PAKCS/KiCS2 distributions.
